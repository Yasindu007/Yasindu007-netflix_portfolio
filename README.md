## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- `yarn` or `npm`

### 1. Set up DatoCMS

This project requires a DatoCMS backend to function.

1.  **Create a DatoCMS Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for a free account at datocms.com.
2.  **Create a New Project**: Start a new project from scratch.
3.  **Get Your API Token**: In your project, go to `Settings` > `API Tokens`. Find the **Read-only API token** and copy it. You will need this for your `.env` file.
4.  **Create Models (Schema)**: This is the most important step. Go to `Settings` > `Models` and create the following models with their respective fields. The API identifiers (e.g., `project`, `contact_me`) are important.
    - **Project** (`project`): `title` (String), `description` (String), `image` (Single Asset), `link` (String).
    - **Skill** (`skill`): `name` (String), `level` (Integer).
    - **Certification** (`certification`): `name` (String), `issuer` (String), `date` (Date), `link` (String).
    - **Timeline** (`timeline`): `company` (String), `role` (String), `duration` (String), `description` (Structured Text).
    - **ContactMe** (`contact_me`): `name` (String), `title` (String), `summary` (Structured Text), `profilePicture` (Single Asset), `email` (String), etc.
    - **ProfileBanner** (`profile_banner`): `title` (String), `description` (String), `backgroundImage` (Single Asset).
    - **Image** (`image`): `assets` (Asset Gallery). This is used for the homepage card images.
5.  **Populate Content**: Go to the `Content` tab and add your personal data to the models you just created.
6.  **Image Titles**: For the `Image` model, upload the images you want for the homepage cards. **Crucially, give each image a `Title` in the media library that exactly matches the card's title** (e.g., "Skills", "Projects", "Experience"). This is how the code maps images to cards.

### 2. Install Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-portfolio.git
    cd netflix-portfolio
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    # or
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create an environment file**: Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (or copy from `.env.example` if present):
    ```
    touch .env
    ```
4.  **Add your API Token**: Add the DatoCMS Read-only API token to your `.env` file.
    ```env
    REACT_APP_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
    ```
5.  **Run the development server**:
    `sh
    yarn start
    # or
    npm start
    `
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Useful Scripts

```bash
npm start         # Run dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Lint TypeScript/TSX
npm run format   # Prettier format
```

## üé® Customization

The beauty of this project is that almost all customization happens in DatoCMS, not in the code.

- **‚úçÔ∏è Changing Text**: Edit the entries in your DatoCMS `Content` section for models like `ProfileBanner` or `ContactMe`.
- **üñºÔ∏è Changing Images**:
  - For the main banner or profile picture, simply replace the image in the corresponding DatoCMS entry.
  - For the homepage "Top Picks" cards, go to your `Image` model in DatoCMS, and upload/change the images in the `assets` gallery. Remember to set the `Title` of each asset correctly.
- **üé≠ Adding/Removing Profiles**: To change the profile types (e.g., add a 'designer' profile), you will need to edit the configuration objects in the following files:
  - `src/profilePage/TopPicksRow.tsx`
  - `src/profilePage/ContinueWatching.tsx`
  - `src/pages/Browse.tsx`
